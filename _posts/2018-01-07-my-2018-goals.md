## My Goals of 2018

Some schools of thought suggest not telling anyone your goals, others recommend publishing them to hold yourself accountable.
I am publishing them as a way for me to keep them fresh in my mind.

My theme of this year is *learning* and my goals are:

1. Start a weekly workshop series on algorithms
2. Give 2 tech talks
3. Read 2 books, An Everyone Culture and How to Outsmart Anyone.

I will aim to:

1. Save more money
2. Think more before I speak
3. Exercise more often than twice a week.
