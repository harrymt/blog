I recently discovered LeetCode, a website with lots of algorithm questions and answers, with an area for just Google questions (premium only).
One question on this, was of medium difficulty:

### Question:

```
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
```

Input: ...
Output: ...

**Example Input**

```
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

**Example Output**

```
