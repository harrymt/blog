Hacks to make your websites faster, better and stronger.
</div>

### 1. `//` links

Using `//` before links enables the browser to choose either http or https.

```html
<!-- Good -->
<a href="//harrymt.com">Website</a>

<!-- Bad -->
<a href="http://harrymt.com">Website</a>
<a href="https://harrymt.com">Website</a>
```

### 2. Place external CSS outside of your HTML

What? Are you insane? Does that even work?

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>

<link href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">
```

Yes, it only loads the CSS from <a href="https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/fontawesome/">font-awesome</a> after loading all of your CSS and all HTML. However, <a href="//www.sitepoint.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg-debate/">font-awesome</a> isn't good anymore.

### 3. Use a Task Runner

I use <a href="//gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> to do mad stuff like <a href="//www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-processhtml">inline</a> all my CSS files!

```html
<head>
  <!-- build:css inline -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css">
  <!-- /build -->
</head>

<!-- Turns into this -->
<head>
  <style>.h1{font-size:13.37em;}</style>
</head>
```

It can also uglify, minify and make tea for you.

### 4. Host side projects for free with a domain name

Use GitHub pages to host all your side projects! Just place a [CNAME](https://github.com/harrymt/harrymt.github.io) file into your `<username>.github.io` repo, [activate GitHub pages](http://www.harrymt.com/blog/2017/02/26/how-i-host-my-side-projects.html) on it, and you are away. All new projects can be accesed like so `<domain>/<repo_name>`, like [this blog](//github.com/harrymt/blog).

CNAME

```
www.harrymt.com
```
