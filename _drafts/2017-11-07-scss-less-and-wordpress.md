3 ways to preprocess your CSS with Wordpress.
</div>

[SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) are CSS preprocessors. Use them and get CSS variables, nesting and lots of good features!

Here are 2 methods for using LESS or SCSS in your Wordpress development flow.

### 1. Using Grunt.js or Gulp.js

Pros: Faster
Cons: Need to have access to the command line


### 2. Using a php pre-processor

Pros: No cmd line neccessary
Cons: Slower? Harder to tell when it actually processed
