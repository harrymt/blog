## Static Analysis for Writing

We lint our source code, analyse our programs, so why not our writing?

Of course there are online checkers, such as [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/). But these aren't integrated into our editors and take away our software developer control.

[Write Good](https://github.com/btford/write-good). A naive linter for English prose. Gives us back this control, letting us integrate this node package into our text editors, like sublime text.

Integrate this with sublime (requires [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [sublime linter](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)):

1. `npm install -g write-good`, to globally install write-good
2. Package Control -> `SublimeLinter-contrib-write-good`


[Write Good Sublime Linter Plugin](https://github.com/ckaznocha/SublimeLinter-contrib-write-good) takes a few seconds to install. Gives you lots of helpful hints for writing well!

This helped me massively while writing my MSc thesis at [UoB](http://www.bris.ac.uk/).


This book also helped me with my writing.
