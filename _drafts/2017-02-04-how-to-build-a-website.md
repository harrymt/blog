<div class="message">
[Beginners] We are going to learn to build a website!
</div>


Based on this [tutorial](http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/tags/)

- [Optional] Download a better text editor, such as Atom, Notepad++, SublimeText or VSCode.
- Create a folder in your documents folder, or desktop, or wherever!
- Open up your text editor and start making a website!

### 1. Create your first page

Type your website...

```html
Hello everyone!
```

- Now press Control/Command and S or File->Save, then choose the folder we created eariler
- Save the file, e.g. `mypage.html` or `index.html`
  - You know how you have images, such as, `.jpeg`, or `.png` or word documents, like `.docx` or `.doc`.
  - It's the same with web page files. These are called `html` files, that is why we end it with `.html`.
  - So when we double click on the file our web browser, e.g. chrome, internet explorer or firefox, can open it
  - As it knows it is a webpage and not an image, or anything else.

We should now have something like this

```
My Website\
  mypage.html
```

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/how-to-code-first.png">


### 2. Making it better

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    Hello everyone!
</body>
</html>
```
